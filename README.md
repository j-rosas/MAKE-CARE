# MAKE-CARE
Make care project objects

Project Overview
Sometimes it is the close cases the ones that most attract our attention 
and with which we can empathize better. This project was inspired by the case 
of a close friend. / Epidermis Bulosa, also known as the ‘Butterfly disease’ is 
a non-contagious and uncommon disease characterized by the formation of blisters 
and wounds on the skin and mucous membranes. In Chile there are
currently about 250 people with this disorder, mostly boys and girls. So far it 
has no cure and the treatment consists of avoiding friction caused by the wounds and 
treating the blisters with bandages and daily cures, since these are cases of people 
with extremely delicate skin. For these cares, it is also a disease that is accompanied 
by a high dependence.
